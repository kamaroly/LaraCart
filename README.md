LaraCart
========

Laravel Cart package coded based on the Codeigniter Cart library
From CodeIgniter to Laravel , The Cart composer package permits items to be added to a session that stays active while a user is browsing your site. These items can be retrieved and displayed in a standard 'shopping cart' format, allowing the user to update the quantity or remove items from the cart.
  Please note that the Cart composer package ONLY provides the core "cart" functionality. It does not provide shipping, credit card authorization, or other processing components.

 * The used class was originally written by the team EllisLab Dev Team, then as I needed same 
 * class to use in laravel , I decided to modify this class and make it composer package for Laravel.
 *
 * I am also planning to add more features to this class such as
 * - Taxes 
 * - Coupons,
 * - Remove multiple items 
 * - Check if Item exists
 * - Cart SubTotal
 * - Cart Quantity : total number of items that are in the cart
 * - Cart seIdentity : Cart Identifier in case we want to use different Cart Identity in the same Session
 * - Cart getIdentity : the cart identifier.
