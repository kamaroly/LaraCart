LaraCart
========

Laravel Cart package coded based on the Codeigniter Cart library

 * The used class was originally written by the team EllisLab Dev Team, then as I needed same 
 * class to use in laravel , I decided to modify this class and make it composer package for Laravel.
 *
 * I am also planning to add more features to this class such as
 * - Taxes 
 * - Coupons,
 * - Remove multiple items 
 * - Check if Item exists
 * - Cart SubTotal
 * - Cart Quantity : total number of items that are in the cart
 * - Cart seIdentity : Cart Identifier in case we want to use different Cart Identity in the same Session
 * - Cart getIdentity : the cart identifier.

Note : this package is still under development it hasn't reached it's stable version
